# Mapty-Workout-Tracker
Mapty-Workout-Tracker is a web application for tracking workouts on a map. Users can log running and cycling activities, view their workout history, and visualize workout locations using the Leaflet library. This project is a practical example of modern JavaScript and HTML/CSS usage, integrating geolocation, local storage, and OOP principles.
